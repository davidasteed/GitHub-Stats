GitHub Users
Iron Yard Front End Immersive
Week 3, Day 1
6 march 2017
Developer:  David Steed

Objective:
Create an application that finds some interesting data about a given GitHub user. Your application should accept a username and API key as arguments on the command line.

Critical Path:

1.  create repository
2.  create package.json with default values
3.  install dependency for fetch() into this repository
4.  validate that package.json is populated
5.  set up basic user input validation (did they enter a username and api key?)
6.  validate that the initial fetch is functional.
7.  if so, finish the others
8.  validate results and re-review for missing assignment requirements
